# SkateLauncher
**SkateLauncher** was a project created to launch the **skate.** leaks (*specifically the September build*) that had many different features including Discord RPC and many different configuration options. the project has since been discontinued due to lack of motivation and interest in **skate.** and will *likely not* start back up in the future.
## Launcher
You can still view the source code and download the launcher at its [Repository](https://github.com/SkateLauncher/SkateLauncher)
